    # Kubernetes can handle multiple hosts in a single Kubernetes cluster, so we must
    # specify which host we want to use. In a local environment, we have to trick the
    # computer into thinking that we are using a real domain name, replacing it by 
    # localhost. In macOs/Linux, we can do this by adding the following line to our
    # /etc/hosts file. In Windows, we can do this by editing the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file.
    # If I'm using minikube, it must be the IP of the minikube VM, which can be found by running
    # minikube ip. If I'm using Docker Desktop, it is the 127.0.0.1 address.
    # Development environment only!
